# Changelog
(10/10/2023)
- Added "Draw Lights" button which toggles on and off the ability to click in your scene to place lights instead of using the camera to "shoot" them
- Added "Transform Override" when in None placement mode. Allowing users to add custom transforms to the lights they create using the tool (and can preview these transforms using Preview Mode)
- Optimized Preview Mode so there is no more lag
- Optimized FOV Lines mode so that it is faster and can update in real time as you change your scene settings
- Fixed FOV lines mode for camera breaking when clicking on other objects while it is active
- Tweaked Temperature Color values
